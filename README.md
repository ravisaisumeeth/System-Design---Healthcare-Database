# 🏥 Hospital Management System – UML-Based System Design Project

**A structured system design project focused on modeling and visualizing a Hospital Management System using UML diagrams.**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to design a robust **Hospital Management System (HMS)** that handles key administrative and medical processes — including **patient registration**, **data storage**, **billing**, and **staff management**. The system supports multiple user types like administrators, doctors, technical staff, and patients.

Developed as part of the **Advanced System Design & Development II** course, this project leverages UML modeling techniques to provide a **complete blueprint** for the system's architecture and functionality.

## 🧩 UML Diagrams Included

### ✅ Use Case Diagram
Illustrates high-level system functionalities and interactions with key actors (Patient, Doctor, Admin).

### ✅ Class Diagram
Models the structure of the system including:
- **Entities**: Patient, Doctor, Technical Staff, Visit, Room
- **Relationships**: "is treated by", "works for", "visits", etc.

### ✅ State Diagram
Tracks the lifecycle of key system objects (e.g., a Patient's admission → discharge process).

### ✅ Activity Diagram
Visualizes workflow logic for processes like patient registration and treatment cycle.

### ✅ Sequence Diagram
Shows dynamic interaction between system components during operations like "Patient visits Doctor".

### ✅ Deployment Diagram
Illustrates system components deployment across:
- Database Server  
- Local Hospital Server  
- Client Desktops  
- Printers  
- User interfaces for employees and patients
